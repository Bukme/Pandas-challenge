# PyCity School Analysis

## Overview
PyCity School Analysis is a Python script designed to analyze school district data and student standardized test scores. It provides detailed insights into various aspects of school performance, including district-wide summaries, school-specific summaries, breakdowns by grade level, school size, spending, and school type.

## Description
This script loads two CSV files containing school and student data and merges them into Pandas DataFrames. It then calculates various metrics such as average scores, passing rates, and overall performance. These metrics are used to create summary tables and visualizations, offering a comprehensive understanding of school performance within the district.

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to provide educational administrators with actionable insights into school performance metrics. By analyzing the data, administrators can identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement across schools and districts. This information can inform decision-making processes related to resource allocation, curriculum development, and educational policies to enhance student outcomes.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.
3. Place the CSV files containing school and student data in a folder named "Resources" within the same directory as the script.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the command `python script_name.py`.
6. The script will generate various summary tables and visualizations in the terminal or output them to separate files, depending on the implementation.
